# CSCI130_Connect4_Project
## Connect 4

#### This is a Connect 4 Game created by Wade Hagen and Yet Chun Fong for CSCI 130 

You can start by typing localhost/mysite/register_mysql.php to open up the Registration Page, then insert your username and password to input an account into the database. Then, login with the username and password that you have inputted. 

After that, you should see "Hello, [Your Username]", which is the landing page after you login. There should be 4 options (Start, Help, Leaderboard, Contact) and a Sign Out button as required in the project guidelines. 

If you clicked Start, then you will be directed to the game page which you need to pick the size of the board: 6x7 or 8x9. After you selected the board size, then the game will start as indicated on the timer. But if you want to go back to the landing back, you can just click Home on the upper left corner of the page.
